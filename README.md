# Forager Bow Enchantment
Adds a new Bow enchantment, "Forager", which teleports items/xp.

"Forager" is a new Ender-themed Bow enchantment which can only be found in End City Chests. This new enchantment has two levels (I & II). The first level teleports XP Orbs upon killing an entity with the enchanted Bow. The second level teleports *both* XP Orbs and Items upon kills. The Forager enchantment is related to the Enderman's power of teleportation - as is indicated by the purple particles and teleport sound when XP/Items are teleported, as well as where its found.

A few notes: 
- The "Forager" effect works as normal with all Arrow types, including Spectral and Tipped Arrows.
- The "Forager" effect will not occur if you use a "Forager" enchanted Bow with Tipped Arrows of Instant Damage, Poison, etc and the potion effect kills the entity.
- If you're playing with my other mod ["Arrow Entity Loot Drop"](https://github.com/Pepperoni-Jabroni/ArrowEntityLootDrop) installed, the dropped arrows will also be teleported to you.
- With Cloth Config installed, you can use the mod's config to control how the "Forager" enchantment is obtained & control whether "Forager I" does XP or items only.
- At some point I'd like to add support for Crossbows, but `EnchantmentTargets` make that tough.
