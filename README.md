# Forager Bow Enchantment
Adds a new Bow enchantment, "Forager", which teleports items/xp.

"Forager" is a new Bow enchantment which can only be found in End City Chests (configurable). This new enchantment has two levels (I & II). The first level teleports XP Orbs upon killing an entity with the enchanted Bow. The second level teleports *both* XP Orbs and Items upon kills. The Forager enchantment is related to the Enderman's power of teleportation - as is indicated by the purple particles and teleport sound when XP/Items are teleported.
